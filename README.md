Upgrading
---------
The React Native upgrade process is miserable. Don't do it. Or if you do, at least
do it on a clean dedicated branch. `npm install` doesn't honor `package-lock.json`,
you need `npm clean-install` for that.


Releasing
---------
https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android

```
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease # To build AAB
./gradlew assembleRelease # For an APK
```
