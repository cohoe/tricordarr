Backlog
* Consider prototyping usersettings here. Store filter and sort preferences
  * Make contentsettibgs part of that - events and lfg
* Swiftarr doesnt display the new marker for forums.
  * I'm somewhat cheating this by passing in the ForumListData from the item.
  * We don't have access to that from other flows.
* Drawer can only call linking. No navigation available. Is there a way?
