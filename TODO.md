* Mute is taking a moment to re sort
* Bring refresh into Swipe button component 
* Add ascending descending sort options. Divider in menu then new options
* event search is missing the important part
* make generic `apiQueryV3()` and audit uses of raw `useQuery()`
  * if response is not the shape of the type then blow up
