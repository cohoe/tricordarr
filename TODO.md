Backlog
* Consider prototyping usersettings here. Store filter and sort preferences
  * Make contentsettibgs part of that - events and lfg
* Swiftarr doesnt display the new marker for forums.
  * I'm somewhat cheating this by passing in the ForumListData from the item.
  * We don't have access to that from other flows.
* Kill enableUserNotifications. It can be easily replaced elsewhere
* blocking a user 404's their profile. respond to that better
* announcements, themes, and schedule dont need an account

Nightly
* Tricordarr somehow created an LFG with a second interval - this should always be 0
* Add mealtime images
* Put event notification shutoff in the settings page with other events
* Something weird happened when allowing battery
* Apiimgae don't circle if refetching. Only if new
* Long press image to download
* Button to jump back up the photo list. Should be part of a generic flat list
* Sending photo report doesn't work
* Separate image stale time setting
