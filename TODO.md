* Schedule
  * Your day as a button filter
  * Should create PE take you back instead? Schedule or to personal view
  * Pressing a schedule day button that needs loading unrenders the buttons and loses place. Use the refresh control instead
  * Kill the personal and favorite dedicated screens. There's no point if they are filters
  * Figure out how to bring back the scroll indicator on the schedule list.
  * Add personal event setting to event settings
  * Replace references to events with schedule. Specifically in help text for settings
* User Profile
  * Favorite user to the head buttons out of the menu. Consider putting seamail in there?
* Help
  * More help to screens. You can easily do screenshots and demos. Example add user profile help
* Add favorites, blocks, mutes to directory? Maybe just favorites
* Add more detailed location to map guessing. Aft or forward, room number guessing
* Empty photo stream is not intuitive
* Saving cruise settings doesn't clear unsaved
* Time zone warning on schedule screens. Consider a banner?
* Default lfg to joined instead of help
* Add day dividers to the lfg lists
* Remove photostream share
